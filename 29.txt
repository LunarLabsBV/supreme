"Nobody can talk to him"
It begins with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard I try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it try by
Life just swifts past away
It's so unreal
Don't look out below
Watch it go right out through the window
It slips right away
It's so unreal
Don't look out below
Right out the window
Trying to hold on
Trynna hold on
Tryin' to hold on
Didn't even know I'm just wasting it all
It had to go
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
But it does
I had to fall
and lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryna hold on Didn't even know I'm wasting it all
Just to watch you go
